# - Lock-Manager is independent node app. Sources are hosted in pit-toolkit repo.
# - The new re-defined Sitrus is also node app. Sources are hosted in the same pit-toolkit repo.
# Given two points above it is enough to have a single fetch step for obtaining Lock Manager and "new Sitrus"
# When it comes to deploying Lock Manager, Sitrus need to be given a location of script
# through which to kick start the deployment. See "deploymentLauncher".
